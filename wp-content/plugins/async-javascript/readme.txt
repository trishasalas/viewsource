This can impact on your page speed and ultimately your ranking within search engines.  It can also impact your users experience.Async Javascript adds a 'async' or 'defer' attribute to all scripts loaded by the WordPress wp_enqueue_script function.  This 'async' or 'defer' attribute forces the javascript to be loaded asynchronously or deferred, therefore speeding up page delivery.== Installation ==Just install from your WordPress "Plugins | Add New" screen and all will be well. Manual installation is very straightforward as well:1. Upload the zip-file and unzip it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress3.
