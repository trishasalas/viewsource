Display Tweets is an easy to use, future proof Twitter feed plugin that uses PHP to make requests to the v1.1 Twitter REST API.

== Description ==

Display Tweets is a very simple and easy to use Twitter feed plugin. It allows you to display your tweets using the shortcode, PHP function or widget. It's completely future proof and makes authenticated requests to the Twitter v1.1 REST API, ensuring that your tweets don't disappear when the old Twitter API is shutdown (soon).

Using the plugin is easy. There are three ways to display your feed.

You can also display your tweets using the included widget.
